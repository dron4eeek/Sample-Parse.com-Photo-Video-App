# CTAssetsPickerController

CTAssetsPickerController is an iOS controller that allows picking multiple photos and videos from user's photo library. The usage and look-and-feel just similar to UIImagePickerController. It uses **ARC** and requires **AssetsLibrary** framework.

## Features
1. Picking multiple photos and videos from user's library.
2. Filtering assets to pick only photos or videos.
3. Limiting maximum number of assets to be picked.
4. Average 5x fps.
5. Conforming UIAccessibility Protocol.

## Minimum Requirement
Xcode 5 and iOS 6.

## Installation

### via CocoaPods
Install CocoaPods if you do not have it:-
````bash
$ [sudo] gem install cocoapods
$ pod setup
````
Create Podfile:-
````bash
$ edit Podfile
platform :ios, '6.0'
pod 'CTAssetsPickerController',  '~> 1.5.0'
$ pod install
````
Use the Xcode workspace instead of the project from now on.

### via Git Submodules

````bash
$ git submodule add http://github.com/chiunam/CTAssetsPickerController
````
1. Drag `CTAssetsPickerController` folder in your project and add to your targets.
2. Add `AssetsLibrary.framework`.

## Usage

See the Demo Xcode project for details.

### Import header

If using CocoaPods:-
```` objective-c
#import <CTAssetsPickerController.h>
````
If using Submodules:-
```` objective-c
#import "CTAssetsPickerController.h"
````

### Create and present CTAssetsPickerController

```` objective-c
CTAssetsPickerController *picker = [[CTAssetsPickerController alloc] init];
picker.delegate = self;
[self presentViewController:picker animated:YES completion:nil];
````

### Customization
You can set max number of selection to limit the assets to be picked.

```` objective-c
picker.maximumNumberOfSelections = 10;
````

If you only want to pick photos or videos, create an `ALAssetsFilter` and assign to `assetsFilter`.
```` objective-c
picker.assetsFilter = [ALAssetsFilter allPhotos]; // Only pick photos.
````    

If you only want to pick assets that meet certain criteria, create an `NSPredicate` and assign to `selectionFilter`.
Assets that does not match the predicate will not be selectable.
```` objective-c
// only allow video clips if they are at least 5s
picker.selectionFilter = [NSPredicate predicateWithBlock:^BOOL(ALAsset* asset, NSDictionary *bindings) {
    if ([[asset valueForProperty:ALAssetPropertyType] isEqual:ALAssetTypeVideo]) {
        NSTimeInterval duration = [[asset valueForProperty:ALAssetPropertyDuration] doubleValue];
        return duration >= 5;
    } else {
        return YES;
    }
}];
````    

Hide the cancel button if you present the picker in `UIPopoverController`.
```` objective-c
picker.showsCancelButton = NO;
````

Show empty photo albums in the picker.
```` objective-c
picker.showsEmptyGroups = YES;
````


### Implement CTAssetsPickerControllerDelegate

The delegate methods are responsible for dismissing the picker when the operation completes. To dismiss the picker, call the [dismissViewControllerAnimated:completion:](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UIViewController_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/UIViewController/dismissViewControllerAnimated:completion:) method of the presenting controller responsible for displaying CTAssetsPickerController object. Please refer to the demo app.

#### didFinishPickingAssets
Tells the delegate that the user finish picking photos or videos.
```` objective-c
- (void)assetsPickerController:(CTAssetsPickerController *)picker didFinishPickingAssets:(NSArray *)assets;
// assets contains ALAsset objects.
````

#### didCancel (Optional)
Tells the delegate that the user cancelled the pick operation.
```` objective-c
- (void)assetsPickerControllerDidCancel:(CTAssetsPickerController *)picker;
````

#### didSelectItemAtIndexPath (Optional)
Tells the delegate that the item at the specified index path was selected.
```` objective-c
- (void)assetsPickerController:(CTAssetsPickerController *)picker didSelectItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath;
// picker.indexPathsForSelectedItems contains indexPaths for selected items
````

#### didDeselectItemAtIndexPath (Optional)
Tells the delegate that the item at the specified path was deselected.
```` objective-c
- (void)assetsPickerController:(CTAssetsPickerController *)picker didDeselectItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath;
````

#### didHighlightItemAtIndexPath (Optional)
Tells the delegate that the item at the specified index path was highlighted.
```` objective-c
- (void)assetsPickerController:(CTAssetsPickerController *)picker didHighlightItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath;
````

#### didUnhighlightItemAtIndexPath (Optional)
Tells the delegate that the highlight was removed from the item at the specified index path.
```` objective-c
- (void)assetsPickerController:(CTAssetsPickerController *)picker didUnhighlightItemAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath;
````


## Note
CTAssetsPickerController does not compress the picked photos and videos. You can process the picked assets via the `defaultRepresentation` property.

For example, you can create `UIImage` from picked assets like this:-

```` objective-c
    ALAssetRepresentation *representation = alAsset.defaultRepresentation;
    
    UIImage *fullResolutionImage =
    [UIImage imageWithCGImage:representation.fullResolutionImage
                        scale:1.0f
                  orientation:(UIImageOrientation)representation.orientation];
````

and create `NSData` of picked vidoes:-

```` objective-c
    ALAssetRepresentation *representation = alAsset.defaultRepresentation;
    
    NSURL *url          = representation.url;
    AVAsset *asset      = [AVURLAsset URLAssetWithURL:url options:nil];
    
    AVAssetExportSession *session =
    [AVAssetExportSession exportSessionWithAsset:asset presetName:AVAssetExportPresetLowQuality];
    
    session.outputFileType  = AVFileTypeQuickTimeMovie;
    session.outputURL       = VIDEO_EXPORTING_URL;
    
    [session exportAsynchronouslyWithCompletionHandler:^{
        
        if (session.status == AVAssetExportSessionStatusCompleted)
        {
            NSData *data    = [NSData dataWithContentsOfURL:session.outputURL];
        }
        
    }];

````
Please refer the documentation of `ALAssetRepresentation` and `AVAssetExportSession`.
